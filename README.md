## RESULTS

### Number of Temperature Measurements
Overall, it seems like June has more temperatures measured in the sample size than December does. 1700 in June vs 1517 in Decemnber
 
### Mean and Standard Deviation Temperature
As expected for a country in the northern hemisphere, the mean temperature in June was higher than the mean temperature in December. That said, since it is a tropical island, the difference is very small and the temperature is still acceptable for surfing. The standard deviation appears to be similar for both months.

### Min and Max Temperature
64 85 56 83

The minimum temperature for June was 64 compared to 56 for December. This is a significant difference, meanwhile the maximum temperatures were similar at 85 in June and 83 in December. 

## SUMMARY
Overall, based on the weather data it seems like the temperatures are great for year round surfing in Oahu. Mr. Avy can expect this to be a popular surfing destination.
